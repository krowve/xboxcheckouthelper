Tampermonkey script.  Not very tested.  Use with caution.  Not sure if microsoft will ban you for constantly refreshing.

The script will monitor if the page is an X Box Series X page.  If it looks to be in stock an alert will play.

The script will also monitor the shopping cart page.  If it appears an X Box is in the cart and it is in stock an alert will play.
