Tampermonkey script.  Not very tested.  Use with caution.  Not sure if microsoft will ban you for constantly refreshing.

microsoft.xbox.watcher.js will monitor if the X Box Series X page and the Halo Limited Edition Bundle.  
If it looks to be in stock an alert will play and it will cart the item 

microsoft.xbox.carthelper.js will monitor the shopping cart page.  If it appears an X Box is in the cart and it is in stock an alert will play 
and it will move to the place order screen.

Occasionally from the cart you may be asked to login.  I've tried to code in clicking the sign in button but it doesn't seem to be working. 
You can also get the lastpass extension to help you stay logged in.   lastpass has an auto login feature.
